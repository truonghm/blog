Hi everyone, beginning today, I'm going to start a series of posts about learning MLOps. This series will cover a wide range of topics as I dive into the world of MLOps, which might include, but not limited to:

- Linux & Bash Scripting
- Advanced Python Packaging, Dependency Management and Workflows (pre-commit, uv, packaging, etc.)
- Deployment: WebAPI, Containerization & Orchestration, CI/CD, IaC
- Cloud Engineering (AWS, GCP)
- Data Engineering
- ML System Design

This is mostly for my own learning purpose, but I hope it can be helpful for others who are also interested in MLOps. Now, let's get started with the first topic: Linux & Bash Scripting.

## Why Linux?

Linux is the most popular operating system for running servers and cloud computing, while also being the dominant OS for software engineering development, which enccompasses ML engineering. Therefore, it's essential for ML engineers to have a good understanding of Linux. Currently, I'm using Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS as my main OS (see specs below).
